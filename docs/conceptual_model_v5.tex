\begin{abstract}
We present a dual-memory model of norm emergence in coordination games. Agents maintain two qualitatively distinct memory systems---an \emph{experience memory} (statistical, FIFO) and a \emph{normative memory} (rule-based, anomaly-tracked)---bridged by a single state variable, predictive confidence. High confidence stabilises experience-based beliefs through an expanded memory window (cognitive lock-in); low confidence makes agents susceptible to norm internalisation via a drift-diffusion process grounded in \citet{germar2014social}. Norms, once crystallised, constrain decisions, strengthen through conformity, erode through anomaly-triggered crises, and are enforced by high-conviction agents who observe violations. Three feedback loops---individual learning, social amplification, and normative pressure---emerge from this architecture without separate mechanisms, producing self-enforcing social norms from a cold start.

\section{Introduction}
% =====================================================================

Starting from a cold start---50-50 random strategy distribution, no shared history---how does randomness become a social norm? Not merely behavioural convergence, but a self-enforcing pattern sustained by mutual expectations \citep{bicchieri2006grammar}. The question has two parts: (1)~how do norms \emph{form}, and (2)~how do norms \emph{persist}? Three decades of computational and evolutionary models have addressed these questions, yet each leaves significant gaps that motivate the present work.

\subsection{Existing Approaches and Their Limitations}

\paragraph{Stochastic best response (Young, 1993).}
\citet{young1993evolution} demonstrated that conventions can emerge from simple adaptive dynamics: agents sample $k$ observations from a fixed memory of length $m$ and play a best response with small noise. Crucially, the stochastically stable equilibrium depends on the ratio $k/m$. Young's framework provides powerful analytical results but treats memory as an \textbf{exogenous parameter set by the modeller}. Agents do not adapt how much they remember based on experience; $m$ and $k$ are the same for a novice as for an expert. Moreover, the model produces \emph{conventions}---behavioural regularities---but has no mechanism for agents to represent these regularities as \emph{rules}. The resulting equilibrium is self-enforcing through best-response dynamics alone, without normative force.

\paragraph{Conformist transmission (Boyd \& Richerson, 1985).}
The cultural evolution tradition, notably \citet{boyd1985culture} and \citet{henrich1998conformist}, shows that a disproportionate tendency to copy the majority (conformist bias) can stabilise norms even against individual-level selection. This is a population-level transmission rule: agents sample $n$ role models and adopt the majority variant. However, conformist transmission \textbf{operates without individual memory}---there is no cognitive representation of past interactions, no tracking of personal experience, and no distinction between ``most people do $X$'' and ``one \emph{should} do $X$.'' Agents copy behaviour but do not internalise rules.

\paragraph{Metanorms (Axelrod, 1986).}
\citet{axelrod1986evolutionary} introduced enforcement as a central mechanism: agents are punished for violating norms, and metanorms punish those who fail to punish. This elegantly addresses second-order free-riding but treats enforcement dispositions (boldness, vengefulness) as \textbf{genetically encoded traits}, not cognitively formed responses. Agents have no memory of past interactions and no belief system; enforcement is an evolved propensity, not a consequence of norm conviction.

\paragraph{Adaptive cognition (Epstein, 2001).}
\citet{epstein2001learning} provides the closest intellectual precursor to our approach. His ``Learning to Be Thoughtless'' model demonstrates that agents can adaptively reduce cognitive effort (sample size) as norms strengthen---entrenched norms make individual deliberation unnecessary. This insight is foundational, but Epstein's feedback runs in \textbf{one direction only}: norm strength reduces cognitive effort, but cognitive effort does not feed back into norm formation. Furthermore, agents maintain a single representation of what to do; there is no architectural distinction between statistical beliefs and normative rules, and no enforcement mechanism.

\paragraph{Norm internalisation as genetic trait (Gavrilets \& Richerson, 2017).}
\citet{gavrilets2017collective} model norm internalisation explicitly: a genetic parameter $\eta$ adds intrinsic value to norm compliance in the agent's utility function. Gene-culture coevolution can select for high $\eta$ under group competition. This addresses \emph{why} internalisation evolves but not \emph{how} it works within a single generation. Norm \textbf{content is exogenous} (what the norm \emph{is} is assumed), agents are \textbf{stateless} (no memory of past interactions), and internalisation is a fixed trait rather than a learned cognitive process.

\paragraph{Convention learning (Shoham \& Tennenholtz, 1997).}
\citet{shoham1997emergence} show that simple learning rules (Highest Cumulative Reward over a window of $m$ rounds) converge to conventions under mild conditions. But $m$ is fixed, there is no cognitive mechanism underlying the learning, and the resulting convention is defined by the analyst, not cognitively represented by agents.

\subsection{Gaps in the Literature}

These approaches, individually influential, share three systematic limitations:

\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=4pt]
    \item \textbf{Exogenous memory.} Memory length, when present at all, is a fixed parameter. No existing model implements the feedback loop between performance and memory that would make memory \emph{endogenous}: better predictions $\to$ more confidence $\to$ longer memory $\to$ more stable beliefs $\to$ better predictions. Yet this loop is precisely how cognitive systems work: we remember more when our environment is predictable, and we predict better when we remember more.

    \item \textbf{No is--ought distinction.} \citet{bicchieri2006grammar} argued forcefully that norms require both empirical expectations (``what \emph{is} done'') and normative expectations (``what \emph{should} be done''). The is--ought gap \citep{hume1739treatise} means that norms cannot be derived from experience alone: an agent who observes that 70\% of partners play strategy~$A$ has an empirical belief, not a norm. Yet virtually all computational models conflate these: agents have a single representation---a belief distribution, a propensity vector, or a utility parameter---that is both descriptive and prescriptive. No model architecturally separates the statistical question ``what is the pattern?'' from the normative question ``what should I do?''

    \item \textbf{Enforcement as a separate mechanism.} When enforcement is modelled at all, it is either an evolved genetic trait \citep{axelrod1986evolutionary}, a rational strategic choice \citep{gavrilets2017collective}, or absent entirely \citep{young1993evolution,epstein2001learning}. In each case, enforcement is a mechanism \emph{added on top} of the basic architecture. No model derives enforcement as an \emph{emergent consequence} of the same cognitive state that governs compliance.
\end{enumerate}

Review articles confirm these gaps. \citet{savarimuthu2011norm} propose a five-stage norm life cycle (creation, identification, spreading, enforcement, emergence) but note that most computational models address only one or two stages. \citet{mahmoud2014review} identify cognitive approaches to norm detection and norm internalisation as underdeveloped, and norm dissolution as minimally researched.

\subsection{This Model}

We address all three gaps through a dual-memory architecture bridged by predictive confidence, detailed in Sections~\ref{sec:experience}--\ref{sec:enforcement_signal}. Table~\ref{tab:model_comparison} summarises the positioning.

\section{Model Overview}
% =====================================================================

\subsection{Environment}

\begin{itemize}[itemsep=2pt]
    \item $N$ agents (even), strategy set $S = \{A, B\}$
    \item Pure coordination game: payoff 1 if both choose same strategy, 0 otherwise
    \item Each time step $t$: agents randomly paired, simultaneous strategy choice
    \item Agents observe partner's strategy (anonymous); additionally observe $k$ random interactions
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Per-Tick Execution Order}

Each tick follows a fixed synchronous pipeline: (1)~random pairing and action, (2)~observation and memory update, (3)~confidence update, (4)~normative DDM or anomaly update, (5)~enforcement broadcast, (6)~metrics. All outcomes are collected before updates are applied in synchronized passes, avoiding within-tick order effects.

\subsection{Agent State}

Each agent $i$ at time $t$ maintains:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{llll}
\toprule
\textbf{Component} & \textbf{Symbol} & \textbf{Type} & \textbf{Role} \\
\midrule
Pred.\ confidence & $C_i(t) \in [0, 1]$ & State variable & Bridges both memories \\
Experience memory & $M_i^E(t)$ & FIFO queue & Statistical belief formation \\
Normative memory & $M_i^N$ & Rule + strength + anomalies & Decision constraint \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Architectural Principle}

Predictive confidence $C_i(t) \in [0,1]$ measures agent $i$'s confidence in the predictability of the social environment. It answers: \emph{``How reliably can I predict what will happen in my next interaction?''} This is distinct from interpersonal trust \citep{rotter1967new} (directed at specific partners) or institutional trust \citep{luhmann1979trust} (directed at organisations). It is a purely epistemic variable---an agent's meta-cognitive assessment of environmental stability, closely related to the inverse of perceived volatility in \citet{behrens2007learning}. $C_i$ governs pre-crystallisation processes (memory window, DDM drift, signal susceptibility) but \emph{not} post-crystallisation compliance, which is governed by norm strength $\sigma_i$ (Section~\ref{sec:decision}).

Predictive confidence is \textbf{not} a parameter of either memory system. It is a single state variable whose semantic interpretation naturally produces two functional roles in the cognitive layer:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
\textbf{Confidence level} & \textbf{Meaning} & \textbf{Consequence} \\
\midrule
Low ($< 0.3$) & ``I cannot predict this environment'' & Short window; own experience unreliable $\to$ susceptible to norm internalisation \\
Medium ($0.3$--$0.7$) & ``I can roughly predict'' & Moderate window; norm provides useful constraint \\
High ($> 0.7$) & ``I can reliably predict'' & Long window; own experience sufficient $\to$ can override norm \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

% =====================================================================
\section{Experience Memory and Cognitive Lock-in}\label{sec:experience}
% =====================================================================

Experience memory is the statistical layer. It stores direct interaction records and (optionally) observation data, producing a belief distribution over strategies.

\subsection{Belief Formation}

\begin{equation}
b_A = \frac{n_A}{|M'^E_i(t)|}, \quad b_B = 1 - b_A
\end{equation}
where $n_A$ is the count of strategy $A$ in the effective window. Default: $[0.5, 0.5]$.

\subsection{Action Selection (Probability Matching)}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:prob_matching}
P(s_i = A) = b_A^{\text{eff}}, \quad P(s_i = B) = b_B^{\text{eff}}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{b}^{\text{eff}}$ is the effective belief after normative constraint (Section~\ref{sec:decision}).

\subsection{Confidence Update}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:confidence_update}
C_i(t\!+\!1) = \begin{cases}
C_i(t) + \alpha (1 - C_i(t)) & \text{if prediction correct} \\
C_i(t) (1 - \beta) & \text{if prediction wrong}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

Prior to each interaction, agent $i$ forms a prediction $\hat{s}_j$ of its partner's strategy. A prediction is \emph{correct} when $\hat{s}_j = s_j$ (the partner's actual choice), regardless of agent $i$'s own action or the resulting payoff. In pure coordination games, prediction accuracy and coordination success are highly correlated, but they are conceptually independent: an agent may predict correctly yet fail to coordinate (e.g., due to stochastic action selection), or coordinate by chance despite an incorrect prediction. This distinction becomes substantive when generalising to asymmetric games, where predicting a partner's behaviour and achieving a favourable outcome may diverge systematically.

Asymmetric by design \citep{slovic1993perceived}: predictive confidence builds slowly through successful predictions (additive, saturating) and collapses quickly after prediction failures (multiplicative). This mirrors the empirical finding that perceived environmental stability is easier to disconfirm than to establish. Steady state:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:confidence_steady}
C^* = \frac{p\alpha}{p\alpha + (1-p)\beta}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Confidence--Memory Window Linkage}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:window}
w_i(t) = \text{base} + \lfloor C_i(t) \times (\text{max} - \text{base}) \rfloor
\end{equation}

The upper bound $\text{max} = 6$ follows \citet{hertwig2010decisions} and \citet{nevo2012bi}, whose BI-SAW model---winner of the 2010 Market Entry Prediction Competition---found that agents recall only the most recent 6 trials.

\subsection{The Cognitive Lock-in Mechanism}

\begin{center}
Majority forms (drift) $\to$ prediction accuracy $\uparrow$ $\to$ confidence $\uparrow$ $\to$ window $\uparrow$ $\to$ beliefs stabilise $\to$ norm resilience $\uparrow$
\end{center}

Probability matching is behaviourally neutral: any norm emergence is attributable to the memory mechanism, not behavioural biases. \textbf{Limitation}: convergence is slow without social amplification.

% =====================================================================
\section{Normative Memory}
% =====================================================================

Normative memory is qualitatively different from experience memory. It stores a \emph{rule}, not data. It acts as a \emph{constraint} on decisions, not a source of beliefs.

\subsection{Structure}

\begin{equation}
M_i^N = \left(\, r_i \in S \cup \{\varnothing\},\;\; \sigma_i \in [0,1],\;\; a_i \in \mathbb{N},\;\; e_i \in \mathbb{R} \,\right)
\end{equation}

\begin{itemize}[itemsep=2pt]
    \item $r_i$: the norm (which strategy is ``the rule''), or $\varnothing$ if no norm has formed
    \item $\sigma_i$: norm strength (how constraining the rule is)
    \item $a_i$: anomaly count (accumulated violations observed)
    \item $e_i$: DDM evidence accumulator (pre-crystallisation)
\end{itemize}

Normative memory is \textbf{not FIFO}. It does not slide, decay, or reweight. Once formed, the norm persists as a discrete rule until overthrown through crisis. Observations feed both memory systems simultaneously: experience memory extracts \emph{frequencies}; normative memory detects \emph{consensus} (pre-crystallisation) or \emph{violations} (post-crystallisation).

\subsection{Norm Formation: Signed Two-Boundary Drift-Diffusion}\label{sec:formation}

Norm formation follows a \emph{signed} two-boundary drift-diffusion process \citep{germar2014social,germar2019learning}. Observations accumulate as strategy-directional noisy evidence; a norm crystallises when accumulated evidence crosses either boundary.

\paragraph{Theoretical basis.} \citet{germar2014social} showed that social norms alter the drift rate in perceptual decision-making, using a standard two-boundary DDM where subjects could shift toward either response. \citet{germar2019learning} demonstrated that this alteration \emph{persists} after social influence is removed---norms are internalised as a persistent cognitive bias, not a transient effect. \citet{tenenbaum2011grow} established that rule learning from examples is fundamentally probabilistic (Bayesian inference over rule hypotheses).

\paragraph{Evidence grade (strong mechanism, provisional functional form).} The empirical support for a diffusion-style mechanism is strong, but Eq.~\ref{eq:drift} is a modelling choice rather than a directly estimated law. In particular, the linear confidence gate $(1-C_i)$ should be treated as a testable assumption. Alternative gates (e.g., logistic or thresholded) are plausible and should be compared against data. The signed two-boundary architecture aligns more closely with \citet{germar2014social}'s original DDM than a single-boundary formulation.

\paragraph{Mechanism.} At each tick, if $r_i = \varnothing$ (no norm yet):

\begin{align}
\text{drift}_i &= (1 - C_i) \times (f_A - f_B) \label{eq:drift} \\
e_i(t\!+\!1) &= e_i(t) + \text{drift}_i + \text{signal\_push}_i + \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_{\text{noise}}^2) \label{eq:ddm} \\
\text{If } |e_i| &\geq \theta_{\text{crystal}}: \quad r_i \leftarrow \begin{cases} A & \text{if } e_i > 0 \\ B & \text{if } e_i < 0 \end{cases},\;\; \sigma_i \leftarrow \sigma_0,\;\; a_i \leftarrow 0 \label{eq:crystal}
\end{align}

where $(f_A - f_B) \in [-1, 1]$ is the \emph{signed} consistency of observed strategies (positive when $A$ dominates, negative when $B$ dominates, zero at 50-50), $\text{signal\_push}_i$ is the directed enforcement signal (Section~\ref{sec:enforcement_signal}; zero when no signal received), and $\theta_{\text{crystal}}$ is the crystallisation threshold. Evidence $e_i$ walks freely on $\mathbb{R}$ with no reflecting boundary; the two absorbing boundaries at $\pm\theta_{\text{crystal}}$ determine both \emph{whether} and \emph{which} norm forms. We therefore interpret Eq.~\ref{eq:drift}--\ref{eq:crystal} as a falsifiable candidate implementation of a confidence-gated norm uptake process, not as a uniquely identified update law.

\paragraph{Design rationale: signed consistency.} Using the signed difference $(f_A - f_B)$ rather than the unsigned maximum $\max(f_A, f_B)$ is critical for three reasons:

\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=2pt]
    \item \textbf{Silence at 50-50}: when the population is evenly split, $f_A - f_B = 0$ and drift vanishes. No norm should form from pure noise---an agent observing equal frequencies of both strategies has no evidence that either is ``the rule.'' With unsigned consistency, $\max(0.5, 0.5) = 0.5 > 0$, which produces spurious norm formation in $\sim$8 ticks.
    \item \textbf{Cancellation}: observations favouring $A$ and observations favouring $B$ produce opposite-sign drift, so they cancel rather than reinforce. This prevents strategy-agnostic evidence accumulation where a mixed environment could drive crystallisation.
    \item \textbf{Direction from accumulation}: the norm's identity ($A$ or $B$) is determined by the \emph{sign of accumulated evidence} at crystallisation, not by a snapshot of the last observation. This makes the norm robust to sampling noise in any single tick.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Properties.}
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=2pt]
    \item \textbf{Stochastic}: noise creates individual variation in crystallisation timing \citep{sanborn2016bayesian}
    \item \textbf{Phase transition}: the norm is a discrete rule, not a gradual belief update
    \item \textbf{Confidence-gated}: low $C_i \to$ high drift rate (``copy when uncertain'', \citealp{rendell2010copy}); high $C_i \to$ low drift rate (own experience sufficient)
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Expected crystallisation time.} For $|\mu| \gg \sigma_{\text{noise}}^2 / \theta_{\text{crystal}}$ (deterministic approximation):
\begin{equation}\label{eq:crystal_time}
\mathbb{E}[T_{\text{crystal}}] \approx \frac{\theta_{\text{crystal}}}{|\mu|} = \frac{\theta_{\text{crystal}}}{(1 - C_i)|f_A - f_B|}
\end{equation}
At 50-50 ($f_A = f_B$), the expected time diverges (pure diffusion: $\mathbb{E}[T] = \theta_{\text{crystal}}^2 / \sigma_{\text{noise}}^2 \approx 900$ ticks with defaults). At 70-30, $\mathbb{E}[T] \approx 13$ ticks. This ensures norms form only when genuine social consensus exists.

\paragraph{Why does a norm form?} The ``should'' does not emerge from the agent's own experience. It is \emph{inferred} from the contrast between the agent's uncertainty and others' consistency \citep{sherif1936psychology,deutsch1955study}:
\begin{quote}
    ``They are so consistent, they must know something I don't. That must be the rule.''
\end{quote}

No agent needs to explicitly ``send'' a normative signal. The first norms are inferred from observed behavioural consistency---a natural byproduct of cognitive lock-in producing high-confidence, high-consistency agents.

\subsection{Norm Maintenance: Anomaly Accumulation}

Once $r_i \neq \varnothing$, the norm is maintained by anomaly tracking, not statistical updating:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:anomaly}
\text{If } s^*_{\text{observed}} \neq r_i: \quad a_i \leftarrow a_i + 1
\end{equation}

Observations \emph{consistent} with the norm cause nothing to the anomaly counter---they are ``normal.'' This is the key non-statistical property: 99 conforming observations and 1 violation $\neq$ ``norm strength = 0.99.'' The 1 violation is an anomaly, not a data point for updating.

\subsection{Norm Strengthening: Conformity Reinforcement}\label{sec:strengthening}

While anomalies erode norms, conforming observations gradually \emph{strengthen} them:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:strengthen}
\text{If } s^*_{\text{observed}} = r_i: \quad \sigma_i \leftarrow \min\!\big(1,\; \sigma_i + \alpha_\sigma (1 - \sigma_i)\big)
\end{equation}

where $\alpha_\sigma$ is a small per-observation strengthening rate (default $0.005$). This is structurally identical to the predictive confidence increase (Eq.~\ref{eq:confidence_update}): additive, saturating at 1, with diminishing returns as strength approaches its ceiling.

\paragraph{Evidence basis.} \citet{will2023stronger} confirmed that stronger norm internalisation predicts stronger compliance and behavioural inflexibility; \citet{gintis2003internalization} showed that internalised norms create intrinsic motivation that deepens with practice. Norms repeatedly validated by experience grow stronger over time.

\paragraph{Asymmetry preserved.} The strengthening rate $\alpha_\sigma = 0.005$ is far slower than crisis decay $\lambda_{\text{crisis}} = 0.3$. This preserves the ``easy to break, hard to build'' asymmetry: a norm can lose 70\% of its strength in a single crisis (10 violations), but requires $\sim$100 conforming observations to recover equivalent ground. The asymmetry mirrors the trust dynamics (Eq.~\ref{eq:confidence_update}) and is consistent with the general negativity bias in social evaluation \citep{slovic1993perceived}.

\paragraph{New emergent property: crisis recovery.} Without strengthening, a norm that survives one crisis is permanently weakened ($\sigma = 0.24$, compliance $= 0.058$). With strengthening, the norm can \emph{recover} if violations cease: $\sigma$ climbs back toward enforcement threshold ($\theta_{\text{enforce}} = 0.7$) in $\sim$29 ticks of conforming observations. This creates a richer norm lifecycle: \emph{formation $\to$ strengthening $\to$ crisis $\to$ recovery or dissolution}.

\subsection{Norm Overthrow: Crisis and Phase Transition}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:crisis}
\text{If } a_i \geq \theta_{\text{crisis}}: \quad \sigma_i \leftarrow \sigma_i \times \lambda_{\text{crisis}}, \quad a_i \leftarrow 0
\end{equation}

When anomalies accumulate past $\theta_{\text{crisis}}$, norm strength drops sharply (not gradually). If $\sigma_i < \sigma_{\min}$:

\begin{equation}
r_i \leftarrow \varnothing, \quad e_i \leftarrow 0 \quad \text{(norm dissolved; open to re-crystallisation)}
\end{equation}

This mirrors Kuhn's (\citeyear{kuhn1962structure}) paradigm shifts: normal science tolerates anomalies until a crisis threshold triggers revolution.

\paragraph{Evidence grade (direction supported, operator exploratory).} Empirical and theoretical literatures support non-linear norm erosion and tipping under sustained violations, but the exact operator in Eq.~\ref{eq:crisis} is a candidate implementation. The anomaly accumulator and multiplicative decay should be validated against alternative collapse operators.

% =====================================================================
\section{Decision Integration}\label{sec:decision}
% =====================================================================

When a norm exists, it constrains the experience-based belief. We model this constraint with a power-family mapping:

\begin{align}
\text{compliance}_i &= \sigma_i^k, \quad k > 1 \label{eq:compliance} \\
\mathbf{b}^{\text{norm}} &= \text{one\_hot}(r_i) \label{eq:norm_belief} \\
\mathbf{b}^{\text{eff}}_i &= \text{compliance}_i \cdot \mathbf{b}^{\text{norm}} + (1 - \text{compliance}_i) \cdot \mathbf{b}^{\text{exp}}_i \label{eq:effective}
\end{align}

Compliance is driven by norm strength $\sigma_i$, not by predictive confidence $C_i$. The exponent $k > 1$ creates a nonlinear threshold: compliance remains high when the norm is strong and drops rapidly only when norm strength erodes through anomaly accumulation (Eq.~\ref{eq:crisis}). With $k = 2$:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
\toprule
Norm strength $\sigma$ & Compliance $\sigma^2$ & Behaviour \\
\midrule
0.9 & 0.81 & Strong norm adherence \\
0.8 (initial) & 0.64 & Norm significantly constrains \\
0.5 & 0.25 & Experience begins to dominate \\
0.3 & 0.09 & Norm weakening \\
0.1 & 0.01 & Norm nearly dissolved \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\paragraph{Why norm strength, not confidence?} The previous formulation $\text{compliance}_i = (1 - C_i)^k$ creates a paradox: as agents successfully coordinate, their predictive confidence $C$ rises, which \emph{reduces} compliance with the very norm that made them successful. At $C = 0.9$, compliance would be only 0.01---the agent essentially ignores the norm. This conflates two distinct concepts: predictive confidence (``I can predict what will happen''---an epistemic assessment) and norm independence (``I don't need the norm''---a decision to override normative constraints). An agent can be highly confident \emph{and} highly norm-compliant, precisely when the norm is the source of that confidence.

\paragraph{Evidence grade (moderate for monotonicity, exploratory for shape).} Existing evidence supports the directional claim that stronger internalisation should predict stronger compliance. However, the exact power form $\sigma_i^k$ and the value of $k$ are not treated here as fixed empirical constants; they are candidate functions to be compared with alternatives (e.g., linear or logistic mappings).

The literature supports this correction: \citet{gintis2003internalization} showed that internalised norms create intrinsic motivation to comply that deepens with practice---stronger internalisation predicts stronger compliance, not weaker.

Using $\sigma_i$ for compliance creates a coherent architecture: the same variable governs compliance (Eq.~\ref{eq:compliance}), enforcement gating (Eq.~\ref{eq:violation_response}), and crisis dynamics (Eq.~\ref{eq:crisis}). Predictive confidence $C_i$ retains its correct roles in norm \emph{formation} (DDM drift $\propto (1 - C)$; Eq.~\ref{eq:drift}) and memory modulation (window $= f(C)$; Eq.~\ref{eq:window}), consistent with the ``copy when uncertain'' principle \citep{rendell2010copy}.

When $r_i = \varnothing$: $\mathbf{b}^{\text{eff}}_i = \mathbf{b}^{\text{exp}}_i$ (pure experience-based decision).

\section{Norm Enforcement: Violation-Triggered Signalling}
% =====================================================================

\subsection{When Do Agents Signal?}

Norm enforcement is \textbf{reactive}, not proactive. An agent broadcasts a normative signal only when three conditions hold simultaneously:

\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=2pt]
    \item The agent \textbf{has a norm} ($r_i \neq \varnothing$)
    \item The agent has \textbf{high norm strength} ($\sigma_i > \theta_{\text{enforce}}$)
    \item The agent \textbf{observes a violation} ($s^*_{\text{observed}} \neq r_i$)
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Theoretical basis.} Altruistic punishment is triggered by observed defection \citep{fehr2002altruistic}, and ambiguity about whether a violation occurred significantly reduces punishment \citep{toribio2023proof}---certainty is a prerequisite for enforcement. The threshold $\theta_{\text{enforce}}$ is a calibratable parameter, not a literature-fixed constant.

\subsection{Asymmetric Response to Violations}

The same observed violation produces qualitatively different responses depending on the observer's norm strength:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:violation_response}
\text{Observe } s^* \neq r_i: \quad \begin{cases}
\sigma_i > \theta_{\text{enforce}}: & \text{broadcast}(r_i) \quad \textit{(``This rule is still right''---enforce)} \\
\sigma_i \leq \theta_{\text{enforce}}: & a_i \leftarrow a_i + 1 \quad \textit{(``My conviction is weak; accumulate anomaly''---update)}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Theoretical basis.} Uncertain agents update toward others' judgments \citep{sherif1936psychology}, while high-conviction agents enforce and resist conformity pressure \citep{chudek2011culture}. This dual response synthesises conformity and punishment literatures: it has not been tested in a single experiment but follows from convergent evidence.

\subsection{Effect of Normative Signals on Receivers}\label{sec:enforcement_signal}

Receiving a normative signal delivers a \emph{directed push} to the DDM evidence accumulator, independent of the receiver's current observations:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:signal_push}
\text{signal\_push}_i = (1 - C_i) \times \gamma_{\text{signal}} \times \text{dir}(s_{\text{enforced}}), \quad \text{dir}(A) = +1,\; \text{dir}(B) = -1
\end{equation}

The push is \emph{additive} (not multiplicative) and enters the DDM update in Eq.~\ref{eq:ddm}. It is confidence-gated: uncertain agents are pushed more strongly.

\paragraph{Why directed push, not drift multiplier?} In the signed DDM, the observation-based drift can temporarily point in the ``wrong'' direction due to sampling noise (e.g., an agent observing 3B/2A in a majority-$A$ population). A multiplicative signal boost would amplify this noise-driven drift in the wrong direction. A directed push ensures the enforcement signal always pushes evidence toward the enforced strategy, regardless of the receiver's current observations.

A normative signal is stronger than a behavioural observation because it carries explicit prescriptive content (``you \emph{should} do $X$''), not merely descriptive information (``someone did $X$'').

% =====================================================================
\section{Three Emergent Feedback Loops}
% =====================================================================

The dual-memory architecture produces three feedback loops without requiring separate mechanisms for each:

\subsection{Loop 1: Cognitive Lock-in (Experience Memory)}

\begin{center}
Correct prediction $\to$ $C \!\uparrow$ $\to$ window $\uparrow$ $\to$ beliefs stabilise $\to$ better predictions
\end{center}

\textbf{Source}: experience memory + confidence update. Operates through cognition, not behaviour \citep{slovic1993perceived}.

\subsection{Loop 2: Social Amplification (Observations)}

\begin{center}
High-confidence agents behave consistently $\to$ observed by others $\to$ others' experience beliefs shift $\to$ more coordination $\to$ confidence rises faster
\end{center}

\textbf{Source}: observations feeding experience memory. Amplifies both positive and negative feedback \citep{toyokawa2019conformist}.

\subsection{Loop 3: Normative Pressure (Emergent)}

\begin{center}
High-confidence agents behave consistently $\to$ low-confidence agents observe consensus $\to$ DDM evidence accumulates $\to$ norms crystallise $\to$ agents follow norms $\to$ more consistency $\to$ agents gain confidence $\to$ agents observe violations and \textbf{enforce} $\to$ enforcement accelerates others' DDM $\to$ cascade
\end{center}

\textbf{Source}: observations feeding normative memory (DDM) + violation-triggered enforcement. This loop \emph{emerges} from the dual-memory architecture---it is not a separate mechanism.

\textbf{Key property}: Loop 3 is the only loop that produces \emph{social norms} in the sense of \citet{bicchieri2006grammar}. Without normative memory, the model produces conventions (Loops 1+2 only). With normative memory, the model produces norms with prescriptive force.


% =====================================================================
\section{Experimental Design}\label{sec:experimental}
% =====================================================================

\subsection{2$\times$2 Factorial}

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
& \textbf{Experience Only} & \textbf{Dual Memory} \\
\midrule
\textbf{Fixed Window} & Baseline & Normative constraint only \\
\textbf{Dynamic Window} & Cognitive lock-in & Full model \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Predictions}

We measure norm emergence on a six-level scale: behavioural regularity (Level~1), accurate beliefs (2), belief consensus (3), norm internalisation (4), and institutional stability (5). Levels~4--5 require normative memory.

\begin{itemize}[itemsep=2pt]
    \item \emph{Baseline}: Slowest convergence. Max: Level~1 (behavioural regularity only).
    \item \emph{Normative only}: Norms form but lack lock-in stability. Max: Level~4, fragile.
    \item \emph{Lock-in only}: Stable conventions, not norms. Max: Level~3.
    \item \emph{Full model}: Fastest and most stable. Max: Level~5 (institutional).
\end{itemize}

% =====================================================================
\section{Testable Hypotheses}\label{sec:hypotheses}
% =====================================================================

\begin{description}[style=nextline]
    \item[H1: Norm formation is stochastic]
    Agents in identical conditions form norms at different times. Test: variance in crystallisation tick across agents with same initial conditions. Grounded in \citet{germar2014social}.

    \item[H2: Low-confidence agents internalise norms first]
    Because DDM drift rate $\propto (1 - C)$. Test: correlate confidence at crystallisation with crystallisation order.

    \item[H3: Same violation $\to$ different responses by norm strength]
    High-$\sigma$ agents enforce; low-$\sigma$ agents accumulate anomalies. Test: track enforcement rate vs.\ anomaly accumulation as function of norm strength.

    \item[H4: Enforcement accelerates the cascade]
    Normative signals boost DDM drift. Test: compare norm adoption speed before and after first enforcement events.

    \item[H5: Dual memory + lock-in $>$ either alone]
    2$\times$2 factorial. Expected interaction effect. Grounded in distinct contributions of stability (lock-in) and prescriptive force (normative memory).

    \item[H6: Norm overthrow requires sustained anomalies, not gradual erosion]
    Introduce controlled violations. Expected: norm persists under sparse violations; collapses abruptly after sustained violations exceed $\theta_{\text{crisis}}$.
\end{description}

\subsection{What Evidence Would Revise This Model}

\begin{itemize}[itemsep=2pt]
    \item If low-confidence agents do not internalise earlier than high-confidence agents, revise the confidence gate in Eq.~\ref{eq:drift}.
    \item If compliance does not increase monotonically with internalisation-strength proxies, revise Eq.~\ref{eq:compliance} and compare alternative mappings.
    \item If ambiguity in violation interpretation does not reduce enforcement, revise the current enforcement gate and threshold assumptions.
    \item If observed norm collapse is gradual under sustained anomalies, replace the current crisis operator (Eq.~\ref{eq:crisis}) with a better-supported erosion process.
\end{itemize}

\section{Summary}
% =====================================================================

\subsection*{Limitations and Open Questions}

\begin{itemize}[itemsep=4pt]
    \item \textbf{Homogeneous agents.} All agents share the same parameters ($\alpha$, $\beta$, $k$, $\theta_{\text{crystal}}$, etc.). Individual heterogeneity in cognitive style, risk attitude, or social sensitivity is not modelled. Introducing parameter distributions is a natural extension but significantly enlarges the parameter space.
    \item \textbf{Two strategies only.} The strategy set $S = \{A, B\}$ limits applicability to binary coordination. Extending to $|S| > 2$ requires a multi-dimensional DDM accumulator and a richer compliance mapping; the signed consistency $(f_A - f_B)$ would need to be replaced by a vector-valued signal.
    \item \textbf{Anonymous interactions.} Agents cannot distinguish partners or track reputations. This rules out partner-specific trust, conditional cooperation, and in-group/out-group effects. The model addresses norm emergence among strangers, not within structured social networks.
    \item \textbf{Functional forms are provisional.} The confidence gate $(1-C_i)$, compliance function $\sigma_i^k$, and crisis operator $\sigma \times \lambda_{\text{crisis}}$ are candidate implementations supported directionally by evidence but not uniquely identified. Alternative forms (logistic, thresholded, gradual erosion) should be compared via simulation.
    \item \textbf{No network structure.} Random pairing implies a well-mixed population. Spatial or network-structured interactions could produce local norms, norm boundaries, and slower diffusion---none of which the current model captures.
    \item \textbf{Norm content is emergent but arbitrary.} The model explains \emph{that} a norm forms and \emph{how}, but in a symmetric coordination game, \emph{which} strategy becomes the norm is determined by early random drift. Extending to asymmetric games where norm content has welfare implications is an important next step.
\end{itemize}

The 2$\times$2 factorial (Section~\ref{sec:experimental}) and testable hypotheses (Section~\ref{sec:hypotheses}) provide the experimental programme for validating and refining the model.
