\begin{abstract}
We present a dual-memory model of norm emergence in coordination games. Agents maintain two qualitatively distinct memory systems: an \emph{experience memory} that tracks interaction history through a confidence-modulated sliding window, and a \emph{normative memory} that stores internalised rules as decision constraints. The two systems are bridged by a single state variable---predictive confidence---which measures the agent's confidence in the predictability of the social environment and governs cognitive adaptation: it controls the experience memory window (cognitive lock-in) and determines susceptibility to norm internalisation (low confidence $\to$ accept external rules). Norm formation follows a drift-diffusion process grounded in \citet{germar2014social}: uncertain agents accumulate stochastic evidence from observing consistent behaviour until a crystallisation threshold is crossed. Norm enforcement is violation-triggered and gated by norm strength $\sigma_i$, consistent with \citet{fehr2002altruistic} and \citet{toribio2023proof}. The three feedback loops of the model---individual learning, social amplification, and normative pressure---emerge naturally from the dual-memory architecture without requiring separate mechanisms.

\section{Introduction}
% =====================================================================

Starting from a cold start---50-50 random strategy distribution, no shared history---how does randomness become a social norm? Not merely behavioural convergence, but a self-enforcing pattern sustained by mutual expectations \citep{bicchieri2006grammar}.

The question has two parts: (1) how do norms \emph{form}, and (2) how do norms \emph{persist}? Existing models typically address these through a single mechanism---imitation, best response, or conformist transmission. We argue that formation and persistence involve \emph{qualitatively different cognitive processes}, served by different memory systems:

\begin{itemize}[itemsep=2pt]
    \item \textbf{Experience memory}: a statistical system that tracks what happened and forms beliefs. It answers ``what \emph{is} the pattern?''
    \item \textbf{Normative memory}: a rule-based system that stores internalised constraints. It answers ``what \emph{should} I do?''
\end{itemize}

The is--ought gap \citep{hume1739treatise} means that norms cannot be derived from experience alone. An agent who observes that 70\% of partners play strategy~$A$ has an empirical belief, not a norm. The transition from ``most people do $A$'' to ``one \emph{should} do $A$'' requires a qualitatively different cognitive step.

We propose that this step is \textbf{norm internalisation}: the process by which an uncertain agent, observing confident and consistent behaviour in others, infers the existence of a rule and adopts it as a decision constraint. Predictive confidence---the agent's confidence in the predictability of the social environment---bridges learning and internalisation across the two memory systems, while norm strength $\sigma_i$ governs enforcement.

\section{Model Overview}
% =====================================================================

\subsection{Environment}

\begin{itemize}[itemsep=2pt]
    \item $N$ agents (even), strategy set $S = \{A, B\}$
    \item Pure coordination game: payoff 1 if both choose same strategy, 0 otherwise
    \item Each time step $t$: agents randomly paired, simultaneous strategy choice
    \item Agents observe partner's strategy (anonymous); additionally observe $k$ random interactions
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Agent State}

Each agent $i$ at time $t$ maintains:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{llll}
\toprule
\textbf{Component} & \textbf{Symbol} & \textbf{Type} & \textbf{Role} \\
\midrule
Pred.\ confidence & $C_i(t) \in [0, 1]$ & State variable & Bridges both memories \\
Experience memory & $M_i^E(t)$ & FIFO queue & Statistical belief formation \\
Normative memory & $M_i^N$ & Rule + strength + anomalies & Decision constraint \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Architectural Principle}

Predictive confidence $C_i(t) \in [0,1]$ measures agent $i$'s confidence in the predictability of the social environment. It answers: \emph{``How reliably can I predict what will happen in my next interaction?''} This is distinct from interpersonal trust (directed at specific partners) or institutional trust (directed at organisations). It is a purely epistemic variable---an agent's meta-cognitive assessment of environmental stability.

Predictive confidence is \textbf{not} a parameter of either memory system. It is a single state variable whose semantic interpretation naturally produces two functional roles in the cognitive layer:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
\textbf{Confidence level} & \textbf{Meaning} & \textbf{Consequence} \\
\midrule
Low ($< 0.3$) & ``I cannot predict this environment'' & Short window; own experience unreliable $\to$ susceptible to norm internalisation \\
Medium ($0.3$--$0.7$) & ``I can roughly predict'' & Moderate window; norm provides useful constraint \\
High ($> 0.7$) & ``I can reliably predict'' & Long window; own experience sufficient $\to$ can override norm \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

% =====================================================================
\section{Experience Memory and Cognitive Lock-in}
% =====================================================================

Experience memory is the statistical layer. It stores direct interaction records and (optionally) observation data, producing a belief distribution over strategies.

\subsection{Belief Formation}

\begin{equation}
b_A = \frac{n_A}{|M'^E_i(t)|}, \quad b_B = 1 - b_A
\end{equation}
where $n_A$ is the count of strategy $A$ in the effective window. Default: $[0.5, 0.5]$.

\subsection{Action Selection (Probability Matching)}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:prob_matching}
P(s_i = A) = b_A^{\text{eff}}, \quad P(s_i = B) = b_B^{\text{eff}}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{b}^{\text{eff}}$ is the effective belief after normative constraint (Section~\ref{sec:decision}).

\subsection{Confidence Update}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:confidence_update}
C_i(t\!+\!1) = \begin{cases}
C_i(t) + \alpha (1 - C_i(t)) & \text{if prediction correct} \\
C_i(t) (1 - \beta) & \text{if prediction wrong}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

Prior to each interaction, agent $i$ forms a prediction $\hat{s}_j$ of its partner's strategy. A prediction is \emph{correct} when $\hat{s}_j = s_j$ (the partner's actual choice), regardless of agent $i$'s own action or the resulting payoff. In pure coordination games, prediction accuracy and coordination success are highly correlated, but they are conceptually independent: an agent may predict correctly yet fail to coordinate (e.g., due to stochastic action selection), or coordinate by chance despite an incorrect prediction. This distinction becomes substantive when generalising to asymmetric games, where predicting a partner's behaviour and achieving a favourable outcome may diverge systematically.

Asymmetric by design \citep{slovic1993perceived}: predictive confidence builds slowly through successful predictions (additive, saturating) and collapses quickly after prediction failures (multiplicative). This mirrors the empirical finding that perceived environmental stability is easier to disconfirm than to establish. Steady state:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:confidence_steady}
C^* = \frac{p\alpha}{p\alpha + (1-p)\beta}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Confidence--Memory Window Linkage}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:window}
w_i(t) = \text{base} + \lfloor C_i(t) \times (\text{max} - \text{base}) \rfloor
\end{equation}

The upper bound $\text{max} = 6$ follows \citet{hertwig2010decisions} and \citet{nevo2012bi}, whose BI-SAW model---winner of the 2010 Market Entry Prediction Competition---found that agents recall only the most recent 6 trials.

\subsection{The Cognitive Lock-in Mechanism}

\begin{center}
Majority forms (drift) $\to$ prediction accuracy $\uparrow$ $\to$ confidence $\uparrow$ $\to$ window $\uparrow$ $\to$ beliefs stabilise $\to$ norm resilience $\uparrow$
\end{center}

Probability matching is behaviourally neutral: any norm emergence is attributable to the memory mechanism, not behavioural biases. \textbf{Limitation}: convergence is slow without social amplification.

% =====================================================================
\section{Normative Memory}
% =====================================================================

Normative memory is qualitatively different from experience memory. It stores a \emph{rule}, not data. It acts as a \emph{constraint} on decisions, not a source of beliefs.

\subsection{Structure}

\begin{equation}
M_i^N = \left(\, r_i \in S \cup \{\varnothing\},\;\; \sigma_i \in [0,1],\;\; a_i \in \mathbb{N},\;\; e_i \in \mathbb{R} \,\right)
\end{equation}

\begin{itemize}[itemsep=2pt]
    \item $r_i$: the norm (which strategy is ``the rule''), or $\varnothing$ if no norm has formed
    \item $\sigma_i$: norm strength (how constraining the rule is)
    \item $a_i$: anomaly count (accumulated violations observed)
    \item $e_i$: DDM evidence accumulator (pre-crystallisation)
\end{itemize}

Normative memory is \textbf{not FIFO}. It does not slide, decay, or reweight. Once formed, the norm persists as a discrete rule until overthrown through crisis.

\subsection{Norm Formation: Drift-Diffusion Crystallisation}\label{sec:formation}

Norm formation follows a drift-diffusion process \citep{germar2014social,germar2019learning}. Observations accumulate as noisy evidence; a norm crystallises when accumulated evidence crosses a threshold.

\paragraph{Theoretical basis.} \citet{germar2014social} showed that social norms alter the drift rate in perceptual decision-making. \citet{germar2019learning} demonstrated that this alteration \emph{persists} after social influence is removed---norms are internalised as a persistent cognitive bias, not a transient effect. \citet{tenenbaum2011grow} established that rule learning from examples is fundamentally probabilistic (Bayesian inference over rule hypotheses).

\paragraph{Evidence grade (strong mechanism, provisional functional form).} The empirical support for a diffusion-style mechanism is strong, but Eq.~\ref{eq:drift} is a modelling choice rather than a directly estimated law. In particular, the linear confidence gate $(1-C_i)$ should be treated as a testable assumption. Alternative gates (e.g., logistic or thresholded) are plausible and should be compared against data.

\paragraph{Mechanism.} At each tick, if $r_i = \varnothing$ (no norm yet):

\begin{align}
\text{drift}_i &= (1 - C_i) \times \text{consistency}(\text{observations}) \label{eq:drift} \\
e_i(t\!+\!1) &= \max\!\big(0,\; e_i(t) + \text{drift}_i + \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_{\text{noise}}^2)\big) \label{eq:ddm} \\
\text{If } e_i &> \theta_{\text{crystal}}: \quad r_i \leftarrow s^*,\;\; \sigma_i \leftarrow \sigma_0,\;\; a_i \leftarrow 0 \label{eq:crystal}
\end{align}

where $\text{consistency} = \max(f_A, f_B)$ over observed strategies, $s^*$ is the dominant observed strategy, and $\theta_{\text{crystal}}$ is the crystallisation threshold. We therefore interpret Eq.~\ref{eq:drift}--\ref{eq:crystal} as a falsifiable candidate implementation of a confidence-gated norm uptake process, not as a uniquely identified update law.

\paragraph{Properties.}
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=2pt]
    \item \textbf{Not deterministic}: noise makes the exact crystallisation moment stochastic, creating individual variation \citep{sanborn2016bayesian}
    \item \textbf{Not purely statistical}: the norm is a discrete rule, not a probability distribution; evidence accumulates toward a phase transition, not a gradual belief update
    \item \textbf{Confidence-gated}: low predictive confidence $\to$ high drift rate (agents who cannot predict the environment absorb norm evidence faster, consistent with ``copy when uncertain''); high predictive confidence $\to$ low drift rate (agents who can already predict the environment have no need to infer external rules)
    \item \textbf{Grounded in ``copy when uncertain''} \citep{rendell2010copy}: agents internalise norms \emph{precisely when} their own experience is unreliable
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Why does a norm form?} The ``should'' does not emerge from the agent's own experience. It is \emph{inferred} from the contrast between the agent's uncertainty and others' consistency \citep{sherif1936psychology,deutsch1955study}:
\begin{quote}
    ``They are so consistent, they must know something I don't. That must be the rule.''
\end{quote}

No agent needs to explicitly ``send'' a normative signal. The first norms are inferred from observed behavioural consistency---a natural byproduct of cognitive lock-in producing high-confidence, high-consistency agents.

\subsection{Norm Maintenance: Anomaly Accumulation}

Once $r_i \neq \varnothing$, the norm is maintained by anomaly tracking, not statistical updating:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:anomaly}
\text{If } s^*_{\text{observed}} \neq r_i: \quad a_i \leftarrow a_i + 1
\end{equation}

Observations \emph{consistent} with the norm cause nothing---they are ``normal.'' This is the key non-statistical property: 99 conforming observations and 1 violation $\neq$ ``norm strength = 0.99.'' The 1 violation is an anomaly, not a data point for updating.

\subsection{Norm Overthrow: Crisis and Phase Transition}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:crisis}
\text{If } a_i \geq \theta_{\text{crisis}}: \quad \sigma_i \leftarrow \sigma_i \times \lambda_{\text{crisis}}, \quad a_i \leftarrow 0
\end{equation}

When anomalies accumulate past $\theta_{\text{crisis}}$, norm strength drops sharply (not gradually). If $\sigma_i < \sigma_{\min}$:

\begin{equation}
r_i \leftarrow \varnothing, \quad e_i \leftarrow 0 \quad \text{(norm dissolved; open to re-crystallisation)}
\end{equation}

This mirrors Kuhn's (\citeyear{kuhn1962structure}) paradigm shifts: normal science tolerates anomalies until a crisis threshold triggers revolution.

\paragraph{Evidence grade (direction supported, operator exploratory).} Empirical and theoretical literatures support non-linear norm erosion and tipping under sustained violations, but the exact operator in Eq.~\ref{eq:crisis} is a candidate implementation. The anomaly accumulator and multiplicative decay should be validated against alternative collapse operators.

% =====================================================================
\section{Decision Integration}\label{sec:decision}
% =====================================================================

When a norm exists, it constrains the experience-based belief. We model this constraint with a power-family mapping:

\begin{align}
\text{compliance}_i &= \sigma_i^k, \quad k > 1 \label{eq:compliance} \\
\mathbf{b}^{\text{norm}} &= \text{one\_hot}(r_i) \label{eq:norm_belief} \\
\mathbf{b}^{\text{eff}}_i &= \text{compliance}_i \cdot \mathbf{b}^{\text{norm}} + (1 - \text{compliance}_i) \cdot \mathbf{b}^{\text{exp}}_i \label{eq:effective}
\end{align}

Compliance is driven by norm strength $\sigma_i$, not by predictive confidence $C_i$. The exponent $k > 1$ creates a nonlinear threshold: compliance remains high when the norm is strong and drops rapidly only when norm strength erodes through anomaly accumulation (Eq.~\ref{eq:crisis}). With $k = 2$:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
\toprule
Norm strength $\sigma$ & Compliance $\sigma^2$ & Behaviour \\
\midrule
0.9 & 0.81 & Strong norm adherence \\
0.8 (initial) & 0.64 & Norm significantly constrains \\
0.5 & 0.25 & Experience begins to dominate \\
0.3 & 0.09 & Norm weakening \\
0.1 & 0.01 & Norm nearly dissolved \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\paragraph{Why norm strength, not confidence?} The previous formulation $\text{compliance}_i = (1 - C_i)^k$ creates a paradox: as agents successfully coordinate, their predictive confidence $C$ rises, which \emph{reduces} compliance with the very norm that made them successful. At $C = 0.9$, compliance would be only 0.01---the agent essentially ignores the norm. This conflates two distinct concepts: predictive confidence (``I can predict what will happen''---an epistemic assessment) and norm independence (``I don't need the norm''---a decision to override normative constraints). An agent can be highly confident \emph{and} highly norm-compliant, precisely when the norm is the source of that confidence.

\paragraph{Evidence grade (moderate for monotonicity, exploratory for shape).} Existing evidence supports the directional claim that stronger internalisation should predict stronger compliance. However, the exact power form $\sigma_i^k$ and the value of $k$ are not treated here as fixed empirical constants; they are candidate functions to be compared with alternatives (e.g., linear or logistic mappings).

The literature supports this correction. \citet{bicchieri2006grammar} argues that norm compliance is conditional on empirical expectations---believing others follow the norm. High predictive confidence means strong empirical expectations, which should \emph{increase} compliance, not decrease it. \citet{rendell2010copy} found that winning strategies in the social learning tournament relied almost exclusively on social learning even when personal information was available; confident agents did not abandon social information. \citet{gintis2003internalization} showed that internalised norms create intrinsic motivation to comply, and \citet{axelrod1986evolutionary} demonstrated that internalisation makes compliance robust by making ``the temptation to defect negative rather than positive.'' \citet{andrighetto2015agents} found that once norms are internalised, agents pursue compliance ``as an end in itself,'' with compliance strength proportional to norm salience. \citet{will2023stronger} confirmed that ``stronger norm internalisation is associated with stronger norm compliance'' and behavioural inflexibility.

Using $\sigma_i$ for compliance creates a coherent architecture: the same variable governs compliance (Eq.~\ref{eq:compliance}), enforcement gating (Eq.~\ref{eq:violation_response}), and crisis dynamics (Eq.~\ref{eq:crisis}). Predictive confidence $C_i$ retains its correct roles in norm \emph{formation} (DDM drift $\propto (1 - C)$; Eq.~\ref{eq:drift}) and memory modulation (window $= f(C)$; Eq.~\ref{eq:window}), consistent with the ``copy when uncertain'' principle \citep{rendell2010copy}.

When $r_i = \varnothing$: $\mathbf{b}^{\text{eff}}_i = \mathbf{b}^{\text{exp}}_i$ (pure experience-based decision).

% =====================================================================
\section{Norm Enforcement: Violation-Triggered Signalling}
% =====================================================================

\subsection{When Do Agents Signal?}

Norm enforcement is \textbf{reactive}, not proactive. An agent broadcasts a normative signal only when three conditions hold simultaneously:

\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=2pt]
    \item The agent \textbf{has a norm} ($r_i \neq \varnothing$)
    \item The agent has \textbf{high norm strength} ($\sigma_i > \theta_{\text{enforce}}$)
    \item The agent \textbf{observes a violation} ($s^*_{\text{observed}} \neq r_i$)
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Theoretical basis.}
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=2pt]
    \item \citet{fehr2002altruistic}: punishment is triggered by observed defection, costly, and directed at violators
    \item \citet{fehr2004third}: 60\% of uninvolved third parties punish norm violations
    \item \citet{toribio2023proof}: across six studies, ambiguity about whether a violation occurred \emph{significantly reduces} punishment. Certainty is a prerequisite for enforcement.
    \item \citet{skitka2010moral}: moral conviction predicts willingness to enforce and resistance to conformity pressure
\end{itemize}

The evidence above strongly supports a certainty-sensitive enforcement boundary (whether a violation is interpreted as a violation). However, $\theta_{\text{enforce}}$ itself is treated as a calibratable model parameter, not a literature-fixed constant.

\subsection{Asymmetric Response to Violations}

The same observed violation produces qualitatively different responses depending on the observer's norm strength:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:violation_response}
\text{Observe } s^* \neq r_i: \quad \begin{cases}
\sigma_i > \theta_{\text{enforce}}: & \text{broadcast}(r_i) \quad \textit{(``This rule is still right''---enforce)} \\
\sigma_i \leq \theta_{\text{enforce}}: & a_i \leftarrow a_i + 1 \quad \textit{(``My conviction is weak; accumulate anomaly''---update)}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Theoretical basis.}
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=2pt]
    \item Uncertain agents \emph{update}: \citet{sherif1936psychology} showed that uncertain individuals converge toward others' judgments. \citet{deutsch1955study} established that uncertainty activates informational influence (learning mode). \citet{cialdini2004social}: uncertainty drives norm-seeking behaviour.
    \item High-conviction agents \emph{enforce}: \citet{skitka2010moral} showed that moral conviction produces enforcement and resistance to conformity. \citet{fehr2000cooperation}: high contributors (most committed) punish most. \citet{chudek2011culture}: norm psychology follows a sequence---infer $\to$ internalise $\to$ enforce. Enforcement requires prior internalisation.
\end{itemize}

This dual response is a \textbf{novel contribution} of our model, synthesising across the conformity, punishment, and moral conviction literatures. It has not been tested in a single experiment but follows as a natural prediction from convergent evidence.

\subsection{Effect of Normative Signals on Receivers}

Receiving a normative signal amplifies the DDM drift rate for norm formation (Eq.~\ref{eq:drift}):

\begin{equation}\label{eq:signal_boost}
\text{drift}_i^{\text{signal}} = (1 - C_i) \times \text{consistency} \times \gamma_{\text{signal}}, \quad \gamma_{\text{signal}} > 1
\end{equation}

A normative signal is stronger than a behavioural observation because it carries explicit prescriptive content (``you \emph{should} do $X$''), not merely descriptive information (``someone did $X$'').

% =====================================================================
\section{Observations: The Dual-Purpose Channel}
% =====================================================================

Observations are processed by \textbf{both} memory systems simultaneously, not routed exclusively to one:

\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=2pt]
    \item \textbf{Experience memory}: observations are additional data points, updating the belief distribution (statistical processing)
    \item \textbf{Normative memory}: the same observations are checked for consensus (rule detection)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If $r_i = \varnothing$: consistency feeds the DDM evidence accumulator (Eq.~\ref{eq:ddm})
        \item If $r_i \neq \varnothing$: violations increment the anomaly counter (Eq.~\ref{eq:anomaly})
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

The two systems extract different information from identical observations: experience memory extracts \emph{frequencies}; normative memory detects \emph{consensus} (or violations of it).

% =====================================================================
\section{Three Emergent Feedback Loops}
% =====================================================================

The dual-memory architecture produces three feedback loops without requiring separate mechanisms for each:

\subsection{Loop 1: Cognitive Lock-in (Experience Memory)}

\begin{center}
Correct prediction $\to$ $C \!\uparrow$ $\to$ window $\uparrow$ $\to$ beliefs stabilise $\to$ better predictions
\end{center}

\textbf{Source}: experience memory + confidence update. Operates through cognition, not behaviour.

\textbf{References}: \citet{slovic1993perceived} (asymmetric confidence dynamics); \citet{behrens2007learning} (volatility-adjusted learning rate).

\subsection{Loop 2: Social Amplification (Observations)}

\begin{center}
High-confidence agents behave consistently $\to$ observed by others $\to$ others' experience beliefs shift $\to$ more coordination $\to$ confidence rises faster
\end{center}

\textbf{Source}: observations feeding experience memory. Amplifies both positive and negative feedback.

\textbf{References}: \citet{toyokawa2019conformist} (conformist social learning); \citet{henrich1998conformist} (conformist transmission).

\subsection{Loop 3: Normative Pressure (Emergent)}

\begin{center}
High-confidence agents behave consistently $\to$ low-confidence agents observe consensus $\to$ DDM evidence accumulates $\to$ norms crystallise $\to$ agents follow norms $\to$ more consistency $\to$ agents gain confidence $\to$ agents observe violations and \textbf{enforce} $\to$ enforcement accelerates others' DDM $\to$ cascade
\end{center}

\textbf{Source}: observations feeding normative memory (DDM) + violation-triggered enforcement. This loop \emph{emerges} from the dual-memory architecture---it is not a separate mechanism.

\textbf{Key property}: Loop 3 is the only loop that produces \emph{social norms} in the sense of \citet{bicchieri2006grammar}. Without normative memory, the model produces conventions (Loops 1+2 only). With normative memory, the model produces norms with prescriptive force.

\textbf{References}: \citet{fehr2002altruistic} (violation-triggered enforcement); \citet{centola2018tipping} (tipping point cascade); \citet{chudek2011culture} (infer $\to$ internalise $\to$ enforce sequence).

\subsection{Loop Interaction}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
& \textbf{Loop 1} & \textbf{Loop 2} & \textbf{Loop 3} \\
& Cognitive lock-in & Social amplification & Normative pressure \\
\midrule
Memory system & Experience & Experience & Normative \\
Drives & Stability & Speed & Norm emergence \\
Mechanism & Window $= f(C)$ & Observation $\to$ belief & DDM $\to$ rule $\to$ enforcement \\
Feedback type & Reinforcing + balancing & Amplifier (both) & Positive with threshold \\
Without it & Slow convergence & No acceleration & Conventions only \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

% =====================================================================
\section{Norm Emergence Phases from Cold Start}
% =====================================================================

\subsection{Detection Levels}

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\small
\begin{tabular}{clll}
\toprule
\textbf{Level} & \textbf{Name} & \textbf{Condition} & \textbf{Threshold} \\
\midrule
0 & \textsc{None} & No regularity & majority $< 0.70$ \\
1 & \textsc{Behavioral} & Behavioural regularity & $\geq 0.95$ for 50 ticks \\
2 & \textsc{Empirical} & + Accurate empirical expectations & belief error $< 0.10$ \\
3 & \textsc{Shared} & + Belief consensus & belief variance $< 0.05$ \\
4 & \textsc{Normative} & + Normative rule internalised & $\geq 80\%$ agents have $r_i \neq \varnothing$ \\
5 & \textsc{Institutional} & + Self-enforcing stability & maintained 200+ ticks \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Level 4 requires normative memory; Level 5 additionally requires violation-triggered enforcement (Loop~3 active).

\subsection{Emergence Timeline}

\paragraph{Phase 1: Random drift (ticks 0--30).}
50-50, no consensus. Confidence declining (predictions $\approx$ random). Short memory windows. Negative feedback dominates. Normative DDM accumulators near zero. Level: \textsc{None}.

\paragraph{Phase 2: Symmetry breaking (ticks 30--80).}
Random drift creates a small majority (55--65\%). Confidence stabilises for majority agents. Observations begin showing bias. DDM evidence starts accumulating in low-confidence agents. Level: approaching \textsc{Behavioral}.

\paragraph{Phase 3: Norm crystallisation (ticks 80--150).}
First norms crystallise (DDM crosses threshold) in the most uncertain agents. These agents start following the norm $\to$ more behavioural consistency. Simultaneously, confidence rises for consistent agents. Level: \textsc{Behavioral} achieved.

\paragraph{Phase 4: Enforcement onset (ticks 150--250).}
Agents who internalised norms early maintain high norm strength. They remain above $\theta_{\text{enforce}}$ and begin broadcasting normative signals when violations are observed. These signals accelerate DDM in remaining agents (Eq.~\ref{eq:signal_boost}). Positive cascade. Level: \textsc{Empirical} $\to$ \textsc{Shared} $\to$ \textsc{Normative}.

\paragraph{Phase 5: Institutional stability (ticks 250+).}
Nearly all agents have norm $+$ high norm strength. Violations are rare and immediately enforced. Anomaly counts stay low. The norm is self-sustaining. Level: \textsc{Institutional}.

    Agents in identical conditions form norms at different times. Test: variance in crystallisation tick across agents with same initial conditions. Grounded in \citet{germar2014social}.

    \item[H2: Low-confidence agents internalise norms first]
    Because DDM drift rate $\propto (1 - C)$. Test: correlate confidence at crystallisation with crystallisation order.

    \item[H3: Same violation $\to$ different responses by norm strength]
    High-$\sigma$ agents enforce; low-$\sigma$ agents accumulate anomalies. Test: track enforcement rate vs.\ anomaly accumulation as function of norm strength.

    \item[H4: Enforcement accelerates the cascade]
    Normative signals boost DDM drift. Test: compare norm adoption speed before and after first enforcement events.

    \item[H5: Dual memory + lock-in $>$ either alone]
    2$\times$2 factorial. Expected interaction effect. Grounded in distinct contributions of stability (lock-in) and prescriptive force (normative memory).

    \item[H6: Norm overthrow requires sustained anomalies, not gradual erosion]
    Introduce controlled violations. Expected: norm persists under sparse violations; collapses abruptly after sustained violations exceed $\theta_{\text{crisis}}$.
\end{description}

\subsection{What Evidence Would Revise This Model}

\begin{itemize}[itemsep=2pt]
    \item If low-confidence agents do not internalise earlier than high-confidence agents, revise the confidence gate in Eq.~\ref{eq:drift}.
    \item If compliance does not increase monotonically with internalisation-strength proxies, revise Eq.~\ref{eq:compliance} and compare alternative mappings.
    \item If ambiguity in violation interpretation does not reduce enforcement, revise the current enforcement gate and threshold assumptions.
    \item If observed norm collapse is gradual under sustained anomalies, replace the current crisis operator (Eq.~\ref{eq:crisis}) with a better-supported erosion process.
\end{itemize}

\section{Summary}
% =====================================================================

\subsection*{The Model in One Paragraph}

Agents maintain two memory systems bridged by predictive confidence. \textbf{Experience memory} stores interaction history in a confidence-modulated sliding window, producing statistical beliefs; this creates \emph{cognitive lock-in} where successful coordination stabilises beliefs through expanded memory. \textbf{Normative memory} stores internalised rules as decision constraints, formed through a stochastic drift-diffusion process \citep{germar2019learning} when uncertain agents observe consistent behaviour. Once formed, norms are maintained through anomaly accumulation (not statistical updating) and overthrown only through crisis-induced phase transitions. Predictive confidence determines whether an agent is a \emph{norm receiver} (low confidence $\to$ cannot predict the environment, so internalises others' consistency as a rule) or a \emph{norm follower} (moderate/high confidence $\to$ norm provides a useful constraint supplementing experience). Enforcement is gated by normative conviction: agents with high norm strength $\sigma_i$ treat violations as errors to be corrected, while low-$\sigma_i$ agents accumulate anomalies. The three feedback loops---cognitive lock-in, social amplification, and normative pressure---emerge naturally from this architecture. The result: a model where experience memory explains norm \emph{stability}, normative memory explains norm \emph{prescriptive force}, and their interaction produces self-enforcing social norms from cold start.

\end{align*}

\subsection*{Relation to Trust Research}

Our predictive confidence variable is related to but distinct from the concept of trust in social psychology. Interpersonal trust \citep{rotter1967new} concerns expectations about specific partners' behaviour; institutional trust \citep{luhmann1979trust} concerns expectations about systemic reliability. Predictive confidence is narrower and more operational: it measures the agent's belief that the social environment is statistically stable enough for past experience to predict future interactions. This aligns with the volatility estimation framework of \citet{behrens2007learning}, where learning rate adjusts to perceived environmental change rate. In our model, predictive confidence \emph{is} the inverse of perceived volatility, implemented through asymmetric update dynamics.

\paragraph{Scope of predictive confidence.} Predictive confidence $C_i$ governs two pre-crystallisation processes: (1)~the experience memory window (Eq.~\ref{eq:window}), determining how much past data the agent retains, and (2)~the DDM drift rate (Eq.~\ref{eq:drift}), determining how quickly the agent absorbs norm evidence (``copy when uncertain''). It does \emph{not} govern post-crystallisation norm compliance. Once a norm has crystallised, compliance is determined by norm strength $\sigma_i$ (Eq.~\ref{eq:compliance}), which tracks the norm's internal integrity through anomaly accumulation and crisis dynamics. This separation reflects the distinction between epistemic uncertainty (``can I predict?'') and normative conviction (``how binding is the rule?'')---an agent may be highly confident in predicting the environment \emph{because} it follows a strong norm, and that confidence should not undermine the very compliance that produces it.
