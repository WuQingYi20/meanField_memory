\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
%% ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

How does a population of anonymous agents, starting from a perfectly symmetric 50-50 behavioural split and no shared history, arrive at a self-enforcing social norm---not merely a behavioural convention, but a shared rule that agents internalise, comply with, and enforce \citep{bicchieri2006grammar}? This report presents ablation and cascade analysis for a dual-memory model that addresses this question. The model equips each agent with two qualitatively distinct memory systems, grounded in separate empirical traditions, and unifies them through a single bridging variable: predictive confidence.

The first mechanism---\emph{experiential memory}---draws on the decisions-from-experience paradigm. \citet{hertwig2010decisions} argued that human decision-makers systematically rely on small, recent samples rather than exhaustive histories; computational models that best predict human behaviour in repeated market-entry games use effective windows of only five to six recent trials \citep{nevo2012bi}. Crucially, this window is not fixed. \citet{behrens2007learning} showed that the human brain continuously tracks environmental volatility and adjusts its learning rate accordingly: in volatile environments where prediction errors are frequent, learning rate increases---mathematically equivalent to shortening the effective memory window---so that recent observations receive greater weight; in stable environments, learning rate decreases, allowing longer integration over past experience. We operationalise this finding through a confidence-adaptive first-in-first-out (FIFO) buffer: predictive confidence~$C$ serves as the agent's estimate of environmental stability (the inverse of perceived volatility), and the effective window length is a monotonically increasing function of~$C$. Successful predictions raise~$C$ and expand the window, stabilising beliefs; prediction failures lower~$C$ and contract it, restoring sensitivity to change. The asymmetric update rule---confidence builds slowly through successful predictions but collapses rapidly after failures---is inspired by \citeauthor{slovic1993perceived}'s (\citeyear{slovic1993perceived}) observation that trust is easier to destroy than to create; we apply the same asymmetry to an agent's confidence in environmental predictability.

The second mechanism---\emph{normative memory}---operationalises norm internalisation as a drift-diffusion process. \citet{germar2014social} demonstrated experimentally that exposure to majority opinion alters the drift rate in perceptual decision-making, shifting subjects' evidence accumulation toward the majority-consistent response. \citet{germar2019learning} further showed that this perceptual shift persists after the social influence is removed, suggesting that repeated exposure to social consensus can produce a lasting cognitive bias. We interpret this persistence as evidence that social influence, under appropriate conditions, can give rise to internalised rules. We model the process as a signed two-boundary drift-diffusion model (DDM) in which observed social consistency accumulates as noisy evidence; when the accumulated evidence crosses a crystallisation threshold, a discrete normative rule forms.

The key architectural decision---that uncertainty promotes norm uptake while certainty promotes reliance on personal experience---is motivated by the broader principle that organisms increase social learning when individual learning is unreliable. \citet{rendell2010copy}, in their social learning strategies tournament, showed that the most successful strategies were those that copied when uncertain---that is, agents who relied on social information precisely when their own assessment of the environment was poor. This maps directly onto our confidence-gated architecture: the DDM drift rate scales with $(1-C)$, so low-confidence agents---those whose predictions of partner behaviour have been failing---accumulate normative evidence rapidly, while high-confidence agents rely predominantly on their experiential memory.

A related but distinct intuition comes from the dual-process literature. \citet{rand2014social} showed that under time pressure or cognitive load, people default to socially learned heuristics, while under deliberation they override these defaults. Our model captures an analogous asymmetry at the learning level rather than the execution level: just as cognitive load shifts behaviour toward social defaults in Rand's framework, low predictive confidence shifts an agent's learning dynamics toward faster uptake of social regularities. We do not claim a strict correspondence---Rand's heuristics are pre-existing defaults being retrieved, whereas our agents are forming new normative representations---but the directional logic is the same: uncertainty favours social over individual information.

Predictive confidence~$C$ thus serves as the single variable that bridges the two memory systems, determining whether an agent's learning is dominated by socially inferred rules or by individually accumulated experience.

The remainder of this report is organised as follows. Section~\ref{sec:model} specifies the model. Section~\ref{sec:ablation} presents a systematic ablation isolating each mechanism's contribution. Section~\ref{sec:cascade} traces the \emph{normative cascade}---the positive-feedback process by which minority norms dissolve and the population locks into consensus---through detailed tick-by-tick analysis. The cascade emerges from the interaction of both mechanisms and cannot be produced by either alone.

\section{Model Description}
\label{sec:model}
%% ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

\subsection{Environment and task}

$N$ agents (even) repeatedly play a symmetric pure coordination game with strategy set $S = \{A, B\}$. There is no payoff asymmetry---$A$ and $B$ are \emph{a priori} equivalent. Each tick proceeds through a synchronous six-stage pipeline.

\paragraph{Information structure.} At each tick, agents are randomly paired via uniform permutation. Each agent observes only its partner's chosen strategy (and optionally $V$ additional strategies sampled from other pairs). No agent ever observes any global statistic. All information is local.

\subsection{Agent state}

Each agent carries two memory systems, a confidence tracker, and derived action variables:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lll@{}}
\toprule
Component & Variables & Role \\
\midrule
Experiential memory & FIFO buffer, $b_{\exp}$, $w$ & Track partner action frequencies \\
Confidence & $C \in [0,1]$ & Prediction accuracy tracker \\
Normative memory & $r$, $\sigma$, $a$, $e$ & Norm rule, strength, anomaly, DDM evidence \\
Derived & compliance $= \sigma^k$, $b_{\mathrm{eff}}$ & Action probability \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Per-tick pipeline}

\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
\item \textbf{Stage 1: Pair and act.} Random permutation forms $N/2$ pairs. Each agent computes an effective belief $b_{\mathrm{eff}}$ and samples an action via probability matching ($P(\text{play } A) = b_{\mathrm{eff}}^A$). Each agent also makes a MAP prediction of its partner's action.

\item \textbf{Stage 2: Observe and update experiential memory.} The partner's action is pushed into a FIFO circular buffer (capacity $= w_{\max}$). The experiential belief is recomputed from the most recent $w$ entries:
\begin{equation}
b_{\exp}^A = \frac{\#A \text{ in last } w \text{ entries}}{w}
\label{eq:bexp}
\end{equation}
Additionally, $V$ strategies are sampled from other pairs for the normative observation set $O_i(t)$.

\item \textbf{Stage 3: Confidence update.} The agent compares its MAP prediction to the partner's actual action:
\begin{equation}
C \leftarrow \begin{cases}
C + \alpha(1 - C) & \text{if prediction correct (additive increase)} \\
C(1 - \beta) & \text{if prediction wrong (multiplicative decay)}
\end{cases}
\label{eq:confidence}
\end{equation}
The memory window is then recomputed: $w = w_{\mathrm{base}} + \lfloor C \cdot (w_{\max} - w_{\mathrm{base}}) \rfloor$. High confidence $\to$ long memory; low confidence $\to$ short memory.

\item \textbf{Stage 4: Normative update.} This stage branches based on crystallisation state.

\item \textbf{Stage 5: Enforcement.} (Disabled in current experiments with $\Phi = 0$.)

\item \textbf{Stage 6: Metrics.} Read-only computation of population-level statistics.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Experiential memory: mean-field estimation}
\label{sec:exp}

Since partners are drawn by random pairing, each observation is an independent sample from the population's action distribution. The FIFO buffer stores $w \in [w_{\mathrm{base}}, w_{\max}]$ such samples, so $b_{\exp}^A$ (Eq.~\ref{eq:bexp}) is an unbiased but noisy estimator of the true population frequency $f_A$:
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E}[b_{\exp}^A] = f_A, \qquad \mathrm{Var}(b_{\exp}^A) = \frac{f_A(1 - f_A)}{w}
\end{equation}

With $w \in [2, 6]$, this variance is substantial. Convergence under experiential memory alone is a \emph{diffusion} process: each agent independently drifts toward the majority, one noisy sample at a time.

\subsection{Normative memory: the DDM-crystallisation system}
\label{sec:norm}

Normative memory operates in two distinct modes, forming a state machine:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{@{}c@{}}
\texttt{NO NORM} $\xrightarrow{|e| \geq \theta_{\mathrm{crystal}}}$ \texttt{HAS NORM}
$\xrightarrow[\sigma < \sigma_{\min}]{\text{crisis} \to \text{dissolve}}$
\texttt{NO NORM}
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\paragraph{Pre-crystallisation (DDM).} An evidence accumulator $e$ integrates social observations:
\begin{equation}
e \leftarrow e + \underbrace{(1 - C) \cdot f_{\mathrm{diff}}}_{\text{confidence-gated drift}} + \underbrace{\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_{\mathrm{noise}}^2)}_{\text{noise}}
\label{eq:ddm}
\end{equation}
where $f_{\mathrm{diff}} = (n_A - n_B)/|O_i|$ measures the signed consistency of the observation set $O_i(t)$. When $|e| \geq \theta_{\mathrm{crystal}}$, the agent \emph{crystallises} a norm: $r = A$ if $e > 0$, $r = B$ if $e < 0$. The norm strength is initialised to $\sigma_0$.

Key property: the drift is gated by $(1 - C)$. Low-confidence agents (uncertain about the environment) accumulate evidence faster and crystallise sooner.

At a symmetric 50-50 population ($f_{\mathrm{diff}} = 0$), the accumulator performs a pure random walk. The expected crystallisation time is $\theta_{\mathrm{crystal}}^2 / \sigma_{\mathrm{noise}}^2$. When the population is asymmetric (e.g., 70\% $A$), there is a positive drift and crystallisation occurs rapidly, predominantly toward the majority direction.

\paragraph{Post-crystallisation (norm maintenance).} Once crystallised, the agent monitors conformity and violations among its observations:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
\item \textbf{Conformity} (observed action matches norm $r$): $\sigma$ increases via $\sigma \leftarrow \sigma + \alpha_\sigma(1 - \sigma)$.
\item \textbf{Violation} (observed action $\neq r$): anomaly counter $a$ increments.
\item \textbf{Crisis}: when $a \geq \theta_{\mathrm{crisis}}$, the norm weakens: $\sigma \leftarrow \lambda_{\mathrm{crisis}} \cdot \sigma$, and $a$ resets to 0.
\item \textbf{Dissolution}: if $\sigma < \sigma_{\min}$ after a crisis, the norm is abandoned. The agent returns to the DDM ($e = 0$) and may crystallise a new norm---potentially for the opposite strategy.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Effective belief: the blending equation}
\label{sec:blend}

A crystallised agent's action probability blends the norm direction with the experiential estimate:
\begin{equation}
b_{\mathrm{eff}}^A = \underbrace{\sigma^k}_{\text{compliance}} \cdot b_{\mathrm{norm}}^A + (1 - \sigma^k) \cdot b_{\exp}^A
\label{eq:beff}
\end{equation}
where $b_{\mathrm{norm}}^A = 1$ if $r = A$ and $0$ if $r = B$, and $k$ is a compliance exponent. For an $A$-crystallised agent with $\sigma = 0.8$, $k = 2$: compliance $= 0.64$, so $b_{\mathrm{eff}}^A = 0.64 + 0.36 \cdot b_{\exp}^A$. Even if $b_{\exp}^A = 0.5$, the agent acts $A$ with probability $0.82$.

An uncrystallised agent simply uses $b_{\mathrm{eff}} = b_{\exp}$ (compliance $= 0$).

\subsection{Initialisation}

All agents start identical: $b_{\exp} = (0.5, 0.5)$, $C = C_0$, $r = \text{none}$, $\sigma = 0$, $e = 0$. The population is perfectly symmetric with respect to $A$ and $B$.

\subsection{Experimental design}

To isolate each memory system's contribution, we ran a $3 \times 2$ factorial:

\begin{itemize}[nosep]
\item \textbf{Factor 1---Experiential memory level} (3 levels):
  \begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item \emph{None}: $b_{\exp}$ reset to 0.5 after every tick (no individual learning).
    \item \emph{Fixed}: FIFO learning with fixed window $w = 5$.
    \item \emph{Dynamic}: FIFO learning with confidence-driven window $w \in [2, 6]$.
  \end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Factor 2---Normative memory}: OFF / ON.
\end{itemize}

Crossed with three population sizes $N \in \{20, 100, 500\}$. Each cell was run for 100 independent trials ($T = 3000$ ticks max).

\paragraph{Convergence criterion.} Behavioural majority $\geq 0.95$ sustained for 50 consecutive ticks.

\subsection{Observations}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Experiential memory is necessary.} Without it (None rows), convergence is 0/100 at all $N$, regardless of normative memory. Adding norms to frozen beliefs raises final majority from $\sim$0.53 to $\sim$0.62 (Table~\ref{tab:majority})---a modest improvement from crystallisation, but far below the 0.95 threshold. Normative memory cannot create a pattern from noise alone.

The mechanism is symmetric cancellation. With $b_{\exp}$ frozen at $0.5$, actions are coin flips, so the DDM performs a pure random walk and crystallises roughly equal numbers of $A$- and $B$-norms (${\sim}50$ vs.\ ${\sim}50$). An $A$-norm agent acts $A$ with $b_{\mathrm{eff}}^A = 0.82$; a $B$-norm agent acts $A$ with $b_{\mathrm{eff}}^A = 0.18$. These biases cancel at the population level: $\mathrm{fraction}_A \approx 0.50 \cdot 0.82 + 0.50 \cdot 0.18 = 0.50$. The resulting violation-rate gap between sides is negligible (${\sim}51\%$ vs.\ ${\sim}49\%$), so both norms reach crisis and dissolve at nearly the same rate---the one-way ratchet that drives the cascade in the full model (Section~\ref{sec:loop}) is effectively disabled. The modest improvement to $0.62$ arises from weak statistical drift accumulated over many crystallise--dissolve--recrystallise cycles, but this drift can never self-amplify to $0.95$ because $b_{\exp}$ is pinned at $0.5$ and the positive-feedback loop through experiential memory is broken.

\item \textbf{Experiential learning alone scales poorly.} Fixed-window convergence degrades from 100\% ($N{=}20$) to 24\% ($N{=}500$), and the mean tick grows roughly linearly with $N$. Dynamic window helps (100\% at all $N$), but the tick still grows from 76 to 467.

\item \textbf{With both systems, convergence is fast, complete, and $N$-robust.} The mean tick only grows from 25 to 43 as $N$ increases 25-fold (Table~\ref{tab:ablation}). Convergence rate is 100\% everywhere. Final majority is always 1.0.

\item \textbf{The speedup grows with $N$} (Table~\ref{tab:speedup}). This is not a constant-factor improvement---it suggests a qualitative change in the convergence mechanism.

\item \textbf{Normative memory compensates for weak experiential learning.} Fixed+Norm and Dynamic+Norm converge at nearly identical speeds ($\sim$10 ticks apart at all $N$). Once the normative cascade fires, the quality of the experiential estimator barely matters.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Deep Analysis: The Normative Cascade}
\label{sec:cascade}
%% ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

The ablation shows \emph{what} each system contributes. This section traces \emph{how}: we tracked every agent's internal state tick by tick in a single diagnostic trial ($N = 100$, Dynamic+Norm, seed = 42).

\subsection{Five phases of norm emergence}

Figure~\ref{fig:anatomy} shows the number of agents in each crystallisation state over time.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[height=0.65\textheight,angle=90,keepaspectratio]{figures/fig2_cascade_anatomy.png}
    \caption{Agent group dynamics: crystallised-$A$ (blue), crystallised-$B$ (red), uncrystallised (grey dashed). Vertical dotted lines mark phase boundaries.}
    \label{fig:anatomy}
\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
\item \textbf{Symmetric random} (tick 1--7). All agents uncrystallised. Actions are coin flips based on $b_{\exp} \approx 0.5$.

\item \textbf{Symmetric crystallisation} (tick 7--30). DDM random walks cross $\pm\theta_{\mathrm{crystal}}$. Agents crystallise roughly evenly: 39\,$A$ vs.\ 38\,$B$ at tick 30. Both sides begin accumulating anomalies from each other. $b_{\exp}$ has barely moved from 0.5.

\item \textbf{Tipping} (tick 30--55). Experiential memory slowly shifts $b_{\exp}$ from 0.50 to $\sim$0.58. The slight $A$-majority means $B$-norms face more violations than $A$-norms. $B$-norms begin dissolving; $A$-norms hold.

\item \textbf{Cascade} (tick 55--72). The $B$-norm count collapses from 27 to 0 in $\sim$15 ticks. Each dissolution feeds the next (see Section~\ref{sec:loop}).

\item \textbf{Lock-in} (tick 72+). All agents are $A$-crystallised. Norm strength recovers, confidence rises to 1.0, $b_{\exp} \to 1.0$.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Both vs.\ Experiential-only: same seed}

Figure~\ref{fig:comparison} overlays the same seed under both conditions. The trajectories are virtually identical until tick 50; the divergence corresponds exactly to the cascade phase.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{figures/fig1_both_vs_exponly.png}
    \caption{Fraction playing $A$: Dual Memory (solid blue) vs.\ Experiential Only (dashed orange), same seed. Shaded region marks the cascade.}
    \label{fig:comparison}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Signal amplification}

Figure~\ref{fig:amplifier} reveals the mechanism behind the divergence. $A$-norm agents act $A$ with $\sim$85\% probability even when $b_{\exp} \approx 0.55$---the blending equation (Eq.~\ref{eq:beff}) converts a weak field signal into strong behavioural commitment. $B$-norm agents act $A$ with only $\sim$12\%. This bimodal output drives the population fraction far more aggressively than $b_{\exp}$ alone could.

\begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{figures/fig4_amplifier.png}
    \caption{Per-group effective belief $b_{\mathrm{eff}}^A$. Blue: $A$-norm. Red: $B$-norm. Grey dashed: uncrystallised. Green dotted: population mean $b_{\exp}$.}
    \label{fig:amplifier}
\end{figure}

\subsection{The feedback mechanism}

Figure~\ref{fig:feedback} traces four coupled variables through the cascade:

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/fig3_feedback_loop.png}
    \caption{(a)~Norm strength $\sigma$: $B$-norms decay faster. (b)~Anomaly counts: $B$-norms approach the crisis threshold while $A$-norms decline. (c)~$b_{\exp}$ tracks the field; $b_{\mathrm{eff}}$ leads it. (d)~Dissolution events (red) and new $A$-crystallisations (blue) cluster in tick 40--70.}
    \label{fig:feedback}
\end{figure}

\subsection{The one-way ratchet}

We tracked every norm-state transition for all 100 agents. Among agents that crystallised to $B$, dissolved, and subsequently re-crystallised:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
\item 44 agents followed $B \to \text{dissolved} \to A$.
\item \textbf{0 agents} followed $B \to \text{dissolved} \to B$.
\end{itemize}

Figure~\ref{fig:lifecycle} visualises these lifecycles. The mean uncrystallised interval is 11.2 ticks---once dissolved, the agent sees a strongly $A$-biased environment and crystallises to $A$ rapidly.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{figures/fig5_agent_lifecycle.png}
    \caption{Lifecycle of 44 agents that transitioned $B \to \text{dissolved} \to A$. Red = $B$-crystallised, grey = uncrystallised, blue = $A$-crystallised. Black dots mark dissolution.}
    \label{fig:lifecycle}
\end{figure}

\subsection{The dual feedback loop}
\label{sec:loop}

The cascade arises from two interlocking positive-feedback loops.

\paragraph{Loop 1: Differential erosion (slow, tick 30--55).} When $n_A > n_B$ among crystallised agents, a $B$-norm agent's partner is more likely to play $A$ (a norm violation). Therefore $B$-norms accumulate anomalies faster, reach crisis sooner, and experience more $\sigma$-decay. As $B$-agents' compliance drops (Eq.~\ref{eq:beff}), they act less distinctly $B$, which makes the environment even more $A$-biased:
\begin{equation}
n_A > n_B \;\Longrightarrow\; \text{anomaly rate}(B) > \text{anomaly rate}(A) \;\Longrightarrow\; \sigma_B \downarrow\; \;\Longrightarrow\; \text{environment more } A\text{-biased}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Loop 2: Dissolution cascade (fast, tick 55--72).} When $\sigma_B$ falls below $\sigma_{\min}$, the agent dissolves and re-enters the DDM. The DDM drift $(1 - C) \cdot f_{\mathrm{diff}}$ is now strongly positive (the environment is majority-$A$), so the agent re-crystallises to $A$ within $\sim$10 ticks. Each $B \to A$ conversion increases $n_A$, accelerating both loops:
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\, n_B}{dt} \;\propto\; -\,n_B \;\cdot\; p_A(n_B), \qquad \frac{\partial\, p_A}{\partial\, n_B} < 0
\end{equation}
(This is a qualitative continuous approximation; the actual dynamics proceed through discrete crisis events---anomaly accumulation to $\theta_{\mathrm{crisis}}$, multiplicative $\sigma$-decay, and dissolution when $\sigma < \sigma_{\min}$.)

\noindent The result is \emph{exponential acceleration}: each dissolution makes the next faster (Figure~\ref{fig:causal}d).

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/fig6_causal_chain.png}
    \caption{The causal chain. (a)~Field asymmetry drives crystallisation asymmetry. (b)~$\sigma_A - \sigma_B$ diverges. (c)~Cumulative dissolutions track cumulative $A$-crystallisations. (d)~$B$-norm count collapses with accelerating rate.}
    \label{fig:causal}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Why this is a phase transition, not diffusion.}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
\item \textbf{Diffusion} (experiential only): each agent independently drifts toward the majority at rate $\sim 1/w$. Convergence time scales as $O(N)$ because the signal must propagate one-hop-at-a-time through random pairings.
\item \textbf{Phase transition} (with norms): once a critical asymmetry is reached ($\sim$55--60\% crystallised to one side), the cascade is self-sustaining and completes in a time determined by the anomaly-to-crisis-to-dissolution pathway---\emph{not} by $N$.
\end{itemize}

This structural difference explains the scaling results in Table~\ref{tab:speedup}: the experiential convergence time grows linearly with $N$, while the cascade time remains approximately constant, so the speedup ratio increases with $N$.

The cascade duration is remarkably stable (median 33.5 ticks). Variability comes from the symmetry-breaking phase, not the cascade itself: the earliest trials happen to get an asymmetric initial draw, while the latest take $\sim$38 ticks to break symmetry.

\subsection{Population-size invariance}

From Table~\ref{tab:ablation}, Dynamic+Norm converges in 25 ticks at $N{=}20$, 37 at $N{=}100$, and 43 at $N{=}500$. A 25-fold increase in population adds only 18 ticks. The cascade mechanism---driven by local anomaly rates, not global diffusion---is inherently $N$-insensitive.

\subsection{Symmetry between strategies}

Of the 30 seeds, 16 converged to $A$ and 14 to $B$---consistent with the model's complete symmetry. The winning side is determined by stochastic fluctuations during the symmetry-breaking phase.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Experiential memory} provides a noisy local estimate of the population behavioural frequency---a stochastic mean-field sensor. It can produce convergence alone, but slowly and with $O(N)$ scaling.

\item \textbf{Normative memory} acts as a signal amplifier: crystallisation converts a weak experiential signal ($b_{\exp} \approx 0.55$) into strong behavioural commitment ($b_{\mathrm{eff}} \approx 0.85$), and the dissolution-recrystallisation cycle ensures that amplification is unidirectional.

\item The amplification creates two interlocking positive-feedback loops (differential erosion $+$ dissolution cascade) that produce a \textbf{phase transition} from symmetric disorder to full consensus in $\sim$30 ticks, largely independent of $N$.

\item Neither system alone is sufficient: without experiential memory, the amplifier has no signal; without normative memory, the signal diffuses slowly.

\item All of this emerges from purely local interactions---no agent ever observes the global state.
\end{enumerate}
